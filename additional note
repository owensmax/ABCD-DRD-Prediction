To run these scripts from start to finish, there are several required files that cannot be posted due to The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study 
data security guidelines. For one, these scripts draw from the ABCD RDS file, which is based on ABCD release 2.0.1 and can be downloaded from the ABCD NDA 
portal (https://nda.nih.gov/abcd) by parties with data access. Additionally, for data filetering, files are needed listing participants of various classes, 
which cannot be posted for data security reasons. These files include lists of participants with acceptable fMRI data quality for the Nback (nback_good.txt), 
Stop Signal Task (sst_good.txt), and Monetary Incentive Delay Task (mid_good.txt), as well as lists of subjects to exclude due to having data from Philips 
scanners (philips.txt) or for having a glitch in their stop signal data (sst_exclude.txt). Further, a list of subjects in the lockbox test set (final_test_subs.txt) 
is needed for the cross-validation setup. We apologize for this inconvencience.
